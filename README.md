**Graphic processing project**

The project is the photorealistic presentation of 3D objects using the OpenGL library. Open Graphics Library is a specification of a standard that broadly defines a cross-platform API used for programming 2D and 3D components of computer programs.
The scene I chose to implement is an airport. The user has the ability to manipulate the scene with the mouse and keyboard.

  **Built With**

    • C
    • C++
    • OpenGL library
    
  **Installation**
  
    1. Install Visual Studio 2019
    2. Install OpenGL
    
  **Run**
  
  The application can be run by downloading all the files and running the executable.
